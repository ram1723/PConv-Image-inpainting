# üñºÔ∏è Image Inpainting for Irregular Holes Using Partial Convolutions

## üíª Tech stack
The application is built completely in [Python](https://www.python.org/). I have created [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) to train the model and the desktop app is built using [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) üêç
